# CryptoCity Calculator

With the added functionalities of car depreciation and age, I tried to develop a simple tool to help anyone in the CryptoCity community to check the average ROI so they (we) can plan our investments easier.

Today this only applies to CryptoCars. If it is a helpful tool I plan to expand it to ~Planes and ~Guards.

This site uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. No private information is required to use it, just input the car attributes and press **CALCULATE**

### DISCLAIMER

I'm not part of the developers nor do I have any business with them, this is just a tool to help those who enjoy the game have a easier time figuring things out.
